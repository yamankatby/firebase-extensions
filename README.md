## 🔌 Connect Firestore Document

The **Connect Firestore Document** extension allows you to automatically keep denormalized data in sync with the source document, simplifying the maintenance of data across multiple documents and reducing the risk of data inconsistencies.

Denormalized data refers to duplicating information across multiple documents or collections to optimize query performance. For example, you can store a user's name and their photo URL in each post document to display the user's information in the post without making a separate query to the users collection.

## 🔗 Firestore One-To-One

The **Firestore One-To-One** extension allows you to establish a one-to-one relationship pattern between two collections in Firestore directly from the Firebase console. This simplifies the process of creating, updating, and deleting linked documents, as well as ensures data consistency across collections.

For example, you could use this extension to link a "users" collection with a "profiles" collection, where each user has only one profile and vice versa.
